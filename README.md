## 📥 Installation

### Windows

You can download manually pre-built release binaries on the [Releases](https://github.com/markterence/discord-activity/releases) page.

Alternatively, you can follow the [development setup instructions](#-development-setup) to build the app from source.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you place or extract in a location where you have write or execute permissions.
> 
> The reason for this is that the app will create dummy game file in the same directory.
> By default, the app will not need to be run as administrator, unless if it was installed in a directory that requires elevated permissions. (e.g. `C:\Program Files\`, root of `C:\`, etc.)


> [!NOTE]
> Webview2 is required to run the app. WebView2 comes preinstalled on Windows 11. On versions older than Windows 11 you may need to install it manually.
> If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2).


## Uninstall

To uninstall the app, simply go to the folder where you extracted or placed the app and delete it's folder and thats it.

The content of the folder may look like this:

```text
discord-quest-completer/
├── discord-quest-completer.exe (main app)
├── data/ 
│   ├── src-win.exe (runner dummy template)
├── games/
│    ├── <game-id>/
```

<!-- COMMENT:
  This folder on local app data seems to only exists when using the installer or when Web API like local storage was used? 
  Bring the section back once it's verified it was also existing using the quick portable builds.
-->
<!--
**Other optional files to remove when uninstalling:**

Delete the `me.markterence.discordquestcompleter` folder on `%localappdata%`. 

```bash
# Put this on File Explorer's address bar to navigate on the folder.
%localappdata%/me.markterence.discordquestcompleter
```

The folder `%localappdata%/me.markterence.discordquestcompleter` contains the WebView2 files used by Tauri for the this app. The contents of the folder varies per-user but it may look this this:

```
EBWebView
.cookies
```


> The `%localappdata%` is a system variable on Windows and is equivalent to `C:\Users\<YOUR USER>\AppData\Local\`.

## ✨ Features

- Simulate playing verified Discord games without intalling a full game!
- Complete Discord Quests requiring 15-minute gameplay (not yet tested for Stream the game Quests)
- Only Discord Verified games are supported. The application fetches a list of games that Discord can automatically detect.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This app creates small executable files that mimic the actual game processes that Discord looks for when detecting a verified game to use it for it's Rich Presence activity.
When launched/played, the tiny executables trigger Discord's Rich Presence/Registed Games detection. Discord checks if Game exe name is running, sometimes it needs to be a folder where the game is supposed to be, thats how mainly it detects the Games, we can clearly see this on the "Registered Games" in the settings.

The dummy game executale files used by this program are placed in a folder called  `games/` folder relative to the main application's exe. As of release build v2025.10.07 the dummy executable file size is around 250kb, it could be smaller but it requires the end-users to install .NET Framework Runtime (which is sometimes comes pre-installed on an up-to-date Windows 11 PC's, so for now the dummy exe using WinAPI through C++ for compatibility rather than C#)

> [!TIP]
> After launching some games over a period of time, those files may accumulate. For a little maintenance, you can manually delete the created folders under the `games/` folder if you need to.


<!--
> _Currently, I am hesitant to add a file‑maintenance operation that deletes or clears the `games/` folder, because doing so may still cause unexpected issues. On Windows, the file system is case‑insensitive, so if you have a file named `Notes.txt` and you issue a command to delete `notes.txt`, Windows will still delete the `Notes.txt` file (the one that begins with a capital “N”)._
-->

## Use Cases

- Complete Discord Quests without downloading massive game files
- Show-off playing the latest games on your status if you want to. (Even if you don't really have it.) (LOL)
- Save disk space while still participating in Discord's Quest.
- I want to complete the Quest but I don't want to install the game's anti-cheat, game is too big, or it won't run on my PC.
- Useful for users with limited internet bandwidth or storage space

<!-- ## 🚀 Planned Features and fixes

- Make the "Stop" button work again if process was terminated outside of app's control.
- Persist games that added on the list so it wont reset.
- Discord Activity Simulator/playground (Customizable rich presence for developers and custom activities)
- Set custom activity status from supported games
- Linux and MacOS support (if possible) -->


## 🖥️ Supported Platforms

- Windows 11 


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🦀 Rust
- 🌐 Vue.js
- 🧰 Tauri


### 🛠️ Development

Install dependencies for the Vue.js frontend using pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
```

Make sure to build and copy the dummy game binary from `src-win` and is add it on tauri application's "resources" folder.

```bash
pnpm build:runner:win && pnpm copy:runner:win
```

Then run the Tauri dev command to start the development server.

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

- Also, get the list of detecatable games from the Discord API: `GET /api/applications/detectable` or `GET /api/:version/applications/detectable` and place the JSON file in `src/assets/gamelist.json`

## Other Alternatives

If you can't install this application for any reason, there is some steps on a gist from [aamiaa](https://github.com/aamiaa/) that allows you to use Discord client's Web Inspector and paste the code provided and complete the quest.
